## ðŸ”§ Tools & Methods Included

- **PC-AiR**: Principal components analysis accounting for relatedness
- **PC-Relate**: Kinship coefficient estimation using genotype data
- **Kinship2 & Pedigree Tools**: Visualizing and parsing family structures
- **PLINK support**: For SNP QC, filtering, and conversion
- **Pedigree-aware SNP filtering and stratified analysis**

## ðŸ§¬ Use Case

This pipeline is designed for genetic studies involving extended families or related individuals, enabling accurate adjustment for relatedness and population structure in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadshirzad/Family-Based-SNP-Analysis.git
